1.what is list 
2.what is a node 
3.defining a node 
4.singly linked list 
5.elementory operations 


list a linear collection of data items also known as list items 


example 1:list of marks 
30,32,30,35,42,38




example 2:lsjt of city names 
"bhopal","delhi","pune","indore","itarsi","jaipur","mumbai","jaipur","gwalior"

"atul"   "savitha"  "akshay"  "shiivam"  "jenil "

//what is a node ?
example 1:list of amrks 
30 10 20 40

to store every value in a variable list can be have n  umber of values so to solve this type of issue 
to make a node object wfirst make a collection class  and than make a def init function to define the sll object 

class Node 
def __inti__(self.item=None ,next=None):
self.item =item
self.necxt =next 


how is the single linked list ;

A singly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores two elements:

Data: The actual value that the node holds.
Pointer (or reference): A reference to the next node in the sequence.
